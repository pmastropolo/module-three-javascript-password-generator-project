# module-three-javascript-password-generator-project

## Description

Created an application to generate a random password. I was provided with some starter code to get started. Client wanted an application to generate stronger passwords, therefore providing better security. When you click the button on the website, it should generate a password. Password should be at least 8 characters, and no more than 128 characters.
